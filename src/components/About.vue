            For this project we decided to work in the liquor sector, because it is an interesting topic and that due to the restrictions that must be of legal age there is no page with shopping cart as such, but rather If there are liquors in stock and where you can pick them up, but you can't make a purchase list as such.
        </p>
        <p>
            This shopping page will allow the user create its own shopping cart adding different types of liquors, user can also search and filter elements by name, category or country of origin from its preferred articles. Once the cart is completed then it can select the address where to pick up elements, and there will pop an alert message that will tell the user to remember to bring up ID to be able to pick up the selected items.
        </p>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned there are some limitations due to legal circumstances that doesn’t allow to be there shopping carts as such, those shopping pages were the first three that pop when liquor store is searched in Google, the only one that allows the user to create a shopping list is the last one, but it doesn’t go straight to the point, you have to navigate first before entering what you are looking for, which is alcohol.
